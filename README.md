This is my attempt at making a comprehensive database for physics themed questions for Jeopardy.

[Jeopardy Labs](https://jeopardylabs.com/)


## Rules

There are three rounds, Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy!

Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! differ in point values.
Final Jeopardy has a single question and answer 

Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! have one and two Daily Doubles, respectively.

## Post reflection rules

Only one team is allowed to answer
If correct, + 100% of points
If wrong, - 50% of points
