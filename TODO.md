## Common categories

List of recurring categoriesEdit


Quotation-mark categories
In these categories, a letter or group of letters will be placed inside quotation marks in the category name; correct responses will begin with, end with, or otherwise contain that letter or group of letters. 
For example, if the category title is "AFTER" CLASS:


Clue: A small earthquake or tremor that occurs following a major one.
Correct response: What is an aftershock?[1] 


CROSSWORD CLUES [Letter][2]
A specialized "quotation mark" category in which the category name gives the first letter and the individual clues give the number of letters in the correct response. Previously known as STARTS WITH [Letter] or FILE UNDER [Letter], these versions did not give the expected number of letters. 
The category is CROSSWORD CLUES "L":


Clue: Quiche kingdom (8). (host states, "eight letters")
Response: What is Lorraine?[3] 


[Number]-LETTER WORDS[4]
Each correct response is a word containing the specified number of letters. 
The category is 13-LETTER WORDS:


Clue: A doctor who specializes in the elderly.
Response: What is a gerontologist?[5] 


WORDS IN [Word]
Each correct response is a word that can be formed from the letters in the given word(s). 
The category is WORDS IN SEPTEMBER:

Clue: Neil Armstrong famously took a small one.
Response: What is a step? [6] 


BEFORE AND AFTER[7]
Inspired by a Wheel of Fortune category, the first and second parts of the question share a word in common. 
A tougher variant is the three-part BEFORE, DURING & AFTER.


Clue: Hemorrhoid remedy for an old Baltimore Sun essayist.
Response: What is Preparation H. L. Mencken? (joining Preparation H and H. L. Mencken) 

JEOPORTMANTEAU![8]
The clue describes two words or phrases which the contestant must combine to form an artificial portmanteau.

Clue: Cone-shaped dwelling plus hide-your-face game played by youngsters.
Response: What is Teepeekaboo? 

ANAGRAMS[9]
Each clue contains the correct response in anagrammed form. Often the category is related to a particular topic. 
The category is ANAGRAMMED ANIMALS:

Clue: It likes to neck: fig fear.
Response: What is giraffe?[10] 

STUPID ANSWERS[11]
The correct response appears, unaltered, in the clue itself â€” although that does not mean it is always obvious.

Clue: In 1985 Neil Simon's "Biloxi Blues" premiered on Broadway at this theater.
Response: What is the Neil Simon Theater?[12] 

SPELLING[13]
The correct response must be spelled out. Sometimes the answer will be spoken by the host, but not shown in the clue. Also known as THE DREADED SPELLING CATEGORY,[14] the words are sometimes taken directly from actual spelling bee contests[15] or are related to a particular topic or letter of the alphabet, as
reflected in the category name. 
The category is CELEBRITY SURNAME SPELLING:

Clue: The actress who'll always be TV's Buffy Summers to us.
Response: Who is G-E-L-L-A-R?[16] 

COMMON BONDS[17]
The correct response is the connection between the three given items.

Clue: Bad habits, footballs, buckets.
Response: What are things you kick? 

NAME'S THE SAME[18]
Two given proper names share the first or last word. 
The category is FIRST NAME'S THE SAME:

Clue: Gable, Clifford, Kent
Response: Who is Clark?[19] 

GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT[20]
Clues in this category present information about two similar-sounding names, one of which is stated in the clue and the other of which is the correct response.

Clue: A gazelle is a graceful animal; this 1841 ballet has been called "the Hamlet of the dance".
Response: What is Giselle? 

ALSO A...
The correct response is also an unrelated thing. 
The category is ALSO A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT:

Clue: Legendary Chicago Bears running back Brian.
Response: Who is Piccolo?[21] 

SOUNDS LIKE[22]
The correct response sounds like an unrelated thing or person. 
The category is SOUNDS LIKE A GAME SHOW HOST:

Clue: Newlyweds know that he wobbled as coach of The Jets in Super Bowl III but didn't fall down.
Response: Who is Weeb Ewbank?[23] (Which sounds like Bob Eubanks, host of The Newlywed Game.) 

HOMOPHONES[24]
The correct response is a word that sounds like the two homonyms referred to in the clue, or sometimes a phrase containing both. 
The category is HOMOPHONIC PAIRS:

Clue: A hidden collection of money.
Response: What is a cash cache? 

RHYME TIME[25]
The correct response contains two consecutive rhyming words. Common variants include CELEBRITY RHYME TIME and BEASTLY RHYME TIME (relating to animals).

Clue: Type of paint for your dromedary.
Response: What is camel enamel?[26] 

QUASI-RELATED PAIRS[27]
The clue describes two unrelated people or things whose names are shared by a well known pair.

Clue: The kernel of a peach & Foucault's famous invention.  Response: What is the pit and the pendulum?[28] 

OPERA[29]
When this category appears, it is often the subject of humor, since the assumption is that the category will be a difficult one. 
The category has on occasion been renamed in a manner acknowledging that assumption (for example, as THE DREADED OPERA CATEGORY[30] or UH-OH, OPERA[31]). 

POTENT POTABLES[32]
An alcoholic drink must be identified from its ingredients.
A variant for younger players is NONPOTENT POTABLES, about soft drinks or other non-alcoholic drinks. 
This category is also a recurring category in the Celebrity Jeopardy! 
sketches on Saturday Night Live, although it has never been picked by a contestant in a sketch.[citation needed] 


POTPOURRI[33]
Also called HODGEPODGE or GOULASH, this is a variety of unrelated topics in the same category;
    it almost always appears in the last (rightmost) column on the board.[citation needed]
    A popular variant is LEFTOVERS, which consists of clues that were not used in previous games because time ran out. 

TAKE IN ORDER
The clues must be requested in order from the lowest value to the highest. Usually, the responses form a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            phrase or list, or each response is connected to the one below it.

## Category Gimmicks

Be aware of the show's category gimmicks. Even though "Jeopardy!" is a test of general knowledge, the show is creative with its category names and how it pairs categories in its games. Some of the methods are described below:
- Theme boards. On a number of occasions, the 6 categories have names that suggest a common theme. 
    For example, the Jeopardy! round of a game that aired in 2004 had a Shakespearean theme, with categories "Richard III" (about the king, not the play), "Much Ado About Nothing" (questions related to nothingness), "Measure for Measure" (covering units of measure), "Hamlets" (related to small towns), "The 'Temp'-ist" (all correct responses included words with the letters "temp"), and "Shakespearean Actors."
- Paired categories. When an entire board is not devoted to a single theme, categories may be paired creatively, such as a category named "St. Paul" about the apostle, followed by a category "Minnesota" about the state of Minnesota. 
    On occasion, the same or a very similar category name may be used in the Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy!
    rounds to cover different subjects, such as "Notions" used in the Jeopardy! 
    round for a category about ideas and in the Double Jeopardy! 
    round for a category on sewing items.
- Gimmick categories. In recent years, "Jeopardy!" has developed a few gimmick categories that test players' knowledge beyond simple recall.
    In "Stupid Answers," the key word of the correct response appears somewhere in the clue. 
    (For example, "While Billy Batson says 'Shazam!' to become Captain Marvel, Freddy Freeman says these words to become Captain Marvel, Jr." "What is 'Captain Marvel'?") In "Rhyme Time," the correct response must include a pair of rhyming words. 
    (For example, "What is a green bean?") In "Before and After," the correct response is a name or phrase composed of 2 parts made into a portmanteau. 
    (For example, "Longtime host of 'American Bandstand' who is secretly Superman." "Who is Dick Clark Kent?")
- Traditional category names. "Jeopardy!" has established traditional names for some of its categories, such as "Name's The Same" for 2 or more items with the same name, "Unreal Estate" for fictional places, and both "Potpourri" and "Hodgepodge" for general knowledge.
    Category names that include quotation marks about part of the name indicate that correct responses will include the letters or word enclosed in the quotes.
- Category name puns. "Jeopardy!" category names frequently are plays on words, such as "See What the CAT Scan Dragged In" or "I'll Be Your Waiter," about people who waited for something.
    The show has frequently punned its "Potpourri" category name with such categories as "Poe-Pourri" (about Edgar Allan Poe), "Pope-Pourri" (about popes), and "Pan and Pot-Pourri" (about cooking).


## Hints for writing

Phrase the clue in an interesting way. "Jeopardy!" clues are distinctive not just for being formatted as answers but for providing information to help the contestants figure out the correct question. This is done in one of several ways:

Factual information. A fact can be the focus of an answer clue, as in "Mary Ann Evans' pen name" for the correct question of "Who is George Eliot?" It can also be a fact subordinate to the primary fact of the question, as in "This Man in Black scored a minor 1984 hit with the country novelty song 'Chicken in Black'" for the correct question "Who is Johnny Cash?" by incorporating Cash's nickname.
Irony. Some clues juxtapose facts of contradictory natures, as in a January 2013 Final Jeopardy! of "The first of Jane Austen's 6 novels to be published in her lifetime, its title is last alphabetically" for the correct question of "What is 'Sense and Sensibility'?"
Style mimicry. Some "Jeopardy!" clues have been done to copy the style of text messages or personal ads, as in "King good at solving riddles wants girl just like the girl who married dear old Dad" for "Who is Oedipus?"
Inside jokes. Just as "Jeopardy!" sometimes uses clever names for its categories, it also uses puns and inside jokes in its clues, such as "Frank Zappa named his band this out of necessity" for "What is the Mothers of Invention?" based on the adage "Necessity is the mother of invention."
